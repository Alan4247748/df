## What Is Activated Carbon?

Activated carbon is designed to capture and adsorb impurities from water and air. It can be made from many sources, for us it's the coconut husks ðŸ¥¥. They go through a refining process to "cook them" and make the material more porous. The result is a material that adsorbs particulates, toxins, and harsh compounds.

## Das Filter

The filter is broken down into three components: ceramic caps, activated carbon, and paper. Plastic-free = woot! Das Filters help reduce impurities and harmful toxins, resulting in a smoother and milder smoke. After trying Das Filters, you'll never use a paper crutch again.
